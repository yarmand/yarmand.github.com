[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/yarmand) introduced public posting and **follow** concept from the beginning
and have been copied by [Google+](https://plus.google.com/104135330570501675673) and more recently by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yann.armand) with the [subscribe button](https://www.facebook.com/about/subscribe).

**But profile follow is a one way selectors. It partially cover the issue because it ignore that a single person produce infos on differentes domains.**

As a normal human, I am curious about several subjects and I produce infos about several subjects.

In my case, I produce informations as a software programer and as a dog trainer. These are completely unrelated subjects followed by completely different people I don't want to bother with non accurate infos.
To prevent that, I have to use multiple profiles and split my identity across them. It can become a nightmare or drive me Schizophrenic.

**So following an identity is not enough. To be efficient we should follow somebody about subjects.**

>for example I can follow [@DHH](http://twitter.com/#!/dhh)on *Ruby* or *programming* but not on *skate boarding*.

**One social profile/identity** should propose **several subjects** (including a *global* one).
I should post to a subject the same way today I post to a [google circle](http://www.google.com/support/plus/bin/static.py?hl=en&guide=1257347&page=guide.cs&rd=1), but as the opposite of google circles, this is not me choosing people receiving infos, **this is people choosing to follow my public subjects**.

**This way we get the double filter of choosing the most interesting people only on subject we care about.**

The main drawback of this method is to reduce [Serendipity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity) which is the life of the internet. As a first response, I should say that every infos producer will have the responsibility of posting unrelated infos on subjects at a frequency acceptable to his followers.
